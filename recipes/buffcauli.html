      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ul>
          <li>1 head of cauliflower washed and dried</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>1 cup flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
          <li>pepper to taste</li>
          <li>⅔ cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
          <li>⅔ cup Buffalo Sauce</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 450°F.</li>
          <li>Cut cauliflower into bite-sized pieces and discard the core.</li>
          <li>
            Combine milk, flour, oil, garlic powder, and pepper in a large bowl.
            Place batter and cauliflower in a large zippered bag and gently toss
            until cauliflower is coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour cauliflower into a large strainer, letting any excess batter
            drip off. You want just a light coating of batter. Sprinkle with
            Panko breadcrumbs and gently toss.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place on a foil-lined pan and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the
            oven and gently toss with buffalo sauce. You want the cauliflower
            coated but not soaked.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place cauliflower back on the pan and bake for an additional 5-10
            minutes or until cauliflower is tender-crisp.
          </li>
          <li>Serve with ranch or blue cheese dressing.</li>
